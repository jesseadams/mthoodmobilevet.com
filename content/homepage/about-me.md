##### Melissa A. (Adams) Robert, D.V.M.

Dr. Adams completed her undergraduate studies at McKendree College (now McKendree University) in Lebanon, IL where she obtained a Bachelor of Science in Biology and Minor in Chemistry before going on to complete the Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine degree at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2007. After graduating, she accepted a position as Associate Veterinarian at the Animal Clinic of Lawrenceville in Southern Illinois where she served the surrounding communities for 6 years before starting the Wabash Valley Mobile Veterinary Clinic. After seeing how far many dedicated clients would drive to seek out quality veterinary care in the region, it was quickly apparent to her that there was a definite need for more readily available services. She was eager to see the mobile clinic function in a similar fashion in the Mt. Hood region after her move to be closer to certain family members (you know who you are!) and has always valued the opportunities to make lasting and meaningful relationships with her clients and colleagues.

She accepted a position as staff veterinarian with Clackamas County Dog Services in May 2018, but continues to provide in home euthanasia services for those in the region. Dr. Adams has a strong interest in preventative medicine and surgery. She has been a member of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) since graduation, has been involved annually with visiting local grade schools and serving as judge in library-sponsored pet shows (loves seeing the excitement vet med instills in the youth). During her spare time, Dr. Adams enjoys her travels and time spent with loved ones, tending to her ‘herd’ of dogs, chickens and cats, seeking out new eateries and getting out in the woods and mountains as much as time will allow.
