My years as a mobile veterinarian have been an unforgettable time in which I have felt that I was able to whole heartedly serve those in my community in a way that I could have never done in a traditional clinic facility. I realize that while the mobile practice held several limitations (no radiography, boarding or hospitalization), it allowed me to function on an even more personal level with many for which I am most grateful. A hearty THANK YOU for having enough faith to take a chance in our services over the years.

When I was offered a position in 2018 where I could help serve the underprivileged and wanting stray dogs brought in to the local municipal shelter for care and safety, as well as being provided some much desired support from animal health colleagues, Mt. Hood Mobile Veterinary Clinic was formally reorganized to offer in-home euthanasia and transportation for cremation services.  

It has always been a priority to me that a pet’s last moments can be in his/her home, surrounded by family without the fear, pain and/or confusion commonly associated with having to be loaded and driven to a veterinary facility. It is also an extremely tough time for the family and having the ability to grieve in one’s own space is monumental. 

Please reach out in whatever form of communication you most prefer (call, text and/or email) with any questions you may have or to schedule an in-home euthanasia visit. The ultimate goal is for your pet (and family) to be as calm and comfortable as possible through the entire process. Thank you for your consideration. If you have come to this page in lieu of an impending loss within the family, my heart goes out to you.. 

With kindest regards,

Melissa A. Robert, D.V.M
